üë®üèª‚Äçüíª **About Me**

I'm a graduate from Binghamton University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My education has provided me with a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, C++, and C, as well as experience in tools like Wireshark.

I believe in leveraging both domains in Software Engineering and IT to enhance productivity in a Technical landscape as shown during my internship at Deltek, where I served as a System Administrator in the IT Infrastructure Team.

Furthermore, my forward-thinking mindset enables me to proactively identify weaknesses within systems and processes. I thrive in developing responsive solutions to address these challenges, as demonstrated in my most recent personal project and my contributions at Deltek, where my engineering mindset allowed me to excel in an IT environment, as evidenced by my automation work.

In addition to my technical skills, I am comfortable around people and possess strong interpersonal skills. I've applied these skills in various roles, such as when I was an ESL teacher at the Chinese American Planning Council, assisted students with IT at Tottenville HS, and worked with hundreds of users worldwide with varying technical abilities at Deltek, all while collaborating with a diverse global team.

üõ†Ô∏è **Professional Experience:**

As a System Administrator Intern at Deltek, I played a pivotal role in orchestrating the EOL transition for Windows Server 2012 R2 systems, ensuring system integrity and mitigating potential vulnerabilities. I streamlined server management procedures, improved IT communication strategies, and facilitated knowledge transfer through comprehensive documentation and training sessions.

Additonally, I automated processes through PowerShell, which significantly increased productivity and efficiency in managing server tasks.

During my time as a Computer Technical Assistant at Tottenville High School, I troubleshooted printer and sound devices, assembled computer labs, and ensured students had functional systems.

üîç **Curiosity & Creation:** 

In addition to my professional engagements, I am an ardent developer and IT enthusiast. 

I've created my [virtual home lab](https://dyang21.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-2/) for hands-on learning after getting my CompTIA Security+ certification. Furthermore, I developed a [continuous data integration/deployment system](https://github.com/dyang21/Continuous-Data-Integration-System) called CDIS. This project was time-sensitive because it was designed as a technical challenge that ChatGPT could not effectively address due to its inherent limitations during the project development period. It shows my background in Software Engineering, Data, and IT while also highlighting my ability to think unconventionally and showcase my skills in future-thinking methods.

My personal projects reflects my commitment to mastering and excelling in these closely interconnected fields.

üèÜ **Certifications & Awards:**

- **Security+ (2020-2026)**: I am [certified](https://www.credly.com/badges/2303fc55-39c7-4af1-a53e-553e16bd6107/linked_in_profile) with Security+, showcasing my proficiency in the cybersecurity domain.
  
- **1st Place Team - Google Tech Challenge 2019 @ Binghamton University**: Demonstrated my problem-solving and teamwork abilities.

- **Finalist - New York City Science and Engineering Fair (NYCSEF)**: Showed my ability to design a [prototype](https://github.com/Ericthestein/NYC-311-Map-App) while working in a team.
