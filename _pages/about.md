👨🏻‍💻 **About Me**

I graduated from Binghamton University with a degree in Computer Science. Over the years, I've honed my skills in languages like Python, C++, and Bash. Beyond programming, I'm well-versed with platforms like Docker, Kubernetes, Linux, and VMWare vSphere.

I also have a knack for leveraging tools such as Kafka, Jenkins, and Flask to tackle a wide range of technical challenges. Excited to bring this diverse skill set to new endeavors!

🛠️ **Professional Experience:**

During my time at Deltek as a System Administrator Intern, I managed the End of Life cycle for Windows Server 2012 R2 and developed various automation scripts. I also served as a Technical Aide at Tottenville High School, where I actively worked in a team to build and prepare technology equipment to cater to the needs of students.

🔍 **Curiosity & Creation:** 

Apart from my professional engagements, my natural curiosity has led me to develop several personal projects. 

From creating a [virtual home lab](https://github.com/dyang21/Virtual-HomeLab) to building a [continuous data integration/deployment system](https://github.com/dyang21/Continuous-Data-Integration-System), I thrive on challenges and diversifying my technical portfolio.
