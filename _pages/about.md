👨🏻‍💻 **About Me**

I'm a recent graduate from Binghamton University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My education has equipped me with a strong foundation in programming languages like Python, C++, and Bash, as well as a wide array of skills and tools like Wireshark. 

In addition to software development, I possess a strong understanding of system administration tools and practices, with hands-on experience in tools such as VMWare vSphere, Docker, Kubernetes, Linux, Kafka, and Jenkins.

🛠️ **Professional Experience:**

As a System Administrator Intern at Deltek, I played a pivotal role in orchestrating the EOL transition for Windows Server 2012 R2 systems, ensuring system integrity and mitigating potential vulnerabilities. I streamlined server management procedures, improved IT communication strategies, and facilitated knowledge transfer through comprehensive documentation and training sessions.

During my time as a Technical Aide at Tottenville High School, I optimized computer setups for school use, configured networking equipment, and ensured students had functional systems.
