👨🏻‍💻 **About Donald**
A graduate from Binghamton University, I possess a comprehensive skill set in computer science. My background encompasses expertise in languages like Python, C++, and Bash. I'm adept with platforms such as Docker, Kubernetes, Linux, and VMWare vSphere. Additionally, I harness tools like Kafka, Jenkins, and Flask to address a diverse array of technical challenges.

🛠️ **Professional Experience:**

During my time at Deltek as a System Administrator Intern, I managed the End of Life cycle for Windows Server 2012 R2 and developed various automation scripts. I also contributed as a Technical Aide at Tottenville High School, handling computer equipment for students.

🔍 **Curiosity & Creation:** 
Apart from my professional engagements, my natural curiosity has led me to develop several personal projects. From creating a virtual home lab to building a continous data integration system, I thrive on challenges and diversifying my technical portfolio.
