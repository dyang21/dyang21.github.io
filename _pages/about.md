👨🏻‍💻 **About Me**

I'm a graduate from Binghamton University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My education has provided me with a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, C++, and Bash, as well as expertise in tools like Wireshark.

I have a keen interest in both system administration and software development, with hands-on experience in VMWare vSphere, Docker, Kubernetes, Linux, Kafka, and Jenkins. 

My passion lies in the intersection of system administration and software development, where I believe the best IT professionals lie.

🛠️ **Professional Experience:**

As a System Administrator Intern at Deltek, I played a pivotal role in orchestrating the EOL transition for Windows Server 2012 R2 systems, ensuring system integrity and mitigating potential vulnerabilities. I streamlined server management procedures, improved IT communication strategies, and facilitated knowledge transfer through comprehensive documentation and training sessions.

Additonally, I streamedlined processes through PowerShell, which significantly increased productivity and efficiency in managing server tasks.

During my time as a Technical Aide at Tottenville High School, I optimized computer setups for school use, configured networking equipment, and ensured students had functional systems.

🔍 **Curiosity & Creation:** 

In addition to my professional engagements, I am an ardent developer and IT enthusiast. 

I've created my [virtual home lab](https://dyang21.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-2/) for hands-on learning after getting my CompTIA Security+ certification. Furthermore, I developed a [continuous data integration/deployment system](https://github.com/dyang21/Continuous-Data-Integration-System), known as CDIS, to demonstrate my technical skills in areas where ChatGPT falls short.

My dedication to these endeavors reflects my commitment to mastering and excelling in these closely interconnected fields.

🏆 **Certifications & Awards:**

- **Security+ (2020-2026)**: I am [certified](https://www.credly.com/badges/2303fc55-39c7-4af1-a53e-553e16bd6107/linked_in_profile) with Security+, showcasing my proficiency in the cybersecurity domain.
