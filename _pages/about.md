👨🏻‍💻 **About Me**

As a graduate of Binghamton University with a degree in Computer Science, I offer a comprehensive skill set that encompasses various programming languages including Python, C++, and Bash. I'm adept with platforms such as Docker, Kubernetes, Linux, and VMWare vSphere.

Additionally, I leverage tools like Kafka, Jenkins, and Flask to address a diverse array of technical challenges.

🛠️ **Professional Experience:**

During my time at Deltek as a System Administrator Intern, I managed the End of Life cycle for Windows Server 2012 R2 and developed various automation scripts. I also contributed as a Technical Aide at Tottenville High School, handling computer equipment for students.

🔍 **Curiosity & Creation:** 

Apart from my professional engagements, my natural curiosity has led me to develop several personal projects. From creating a [virtual home lab](https://github.com/dyang21/Virtual-HomeLab) to building a [continuous data integration system](https://github.com/dyang21/Continuous-Data-Integration-System), I thrive on challenges and diversifying my technical portfolio.
