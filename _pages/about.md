üë®üèª‚Äçüíª **About Me**

I'm a graduate from Binghamton University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My education has provided me with a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, C++, and Bash, as well as experience in tools like Wireshark.

I believe in leveraging both domains in Software Engineering and IT to enhance productivity in a Technical landscape as shown during my internship at Deltek, where I served as a System Administrator in the IT Infrastructure Team.

Furthermore, my forward-thinking mindset enables me to proactively identify weaknesses within systems and processes. I excel in developing responsive solutions to address these challenges as demonstrated in my most recent personal project and my contributions at Deltek.

In addition to my technical skills, I am comfortable around people and possess strong interpersonal skills. I've applied these skills in various roles, such as when I was an ESL teacher at the Chinese American Planning Council, assisted students with IT at Tottenville HS, and worked with hundreds of users worldwide with varying technical abilities at Deltek, all while collaborating with a diverse global team.

üõ†Ô∏è **Professional Experience:**

As a System Administrator Intern at Deltek, I played a pivotal role in orchestrating the EOL transition for Windows Server 2012 R2 systems, ensuring system integrity and mitigating potential vulnerabilities. I streamlined server management procedures, improved IT communication strategies, and facilitated knowledge transfer through comprehensive documentation and training sessions.

Additonally, I streamedlined processes through PowerShell, which significantly increased productivity and efficiency in managing server tasks.

During my time as a Technical Aide at Tottenville High School, I optimized computer setups for school use, configured networking equipment, and ensured students had functional systems.

üîç **Curiosity & Creation:** 

In addition to my professional engagements, I am an ardent developer and IT enthusiast. 

I've created my [virtual home lab](https://dyang21.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-2/) for hands-on learning after getting my CompTIA Security+ certification. Furthermore, I developed a [continuous data integration/deployment system](https://github.com/dyang21/Continuous-Data-Integration-System), known as CDIS, to demonstrate my technical skills in areas where ChatGPT falls short.

My dedication to these endeavors reflects my commitment to mastering and excelling in these closely interconnected fields.

üèÜ **Certifications & Awards:**

- **Security+ (2020-2026)**: I am [certified](https://www.credly.com/badges/2303fc55-39c7-4af1-a53e-553e16bd6107/linked_in_profile) with Security+, showcasing my proficiency in the cybersecurity domain.
  
- **1st Place Team - Google Tech Challenge 2019 @ Binghamton University**: Demonstrated my problem-solving and teamwork abilities.
