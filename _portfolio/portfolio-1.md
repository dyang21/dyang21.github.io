The project involves building a real-time analytics system that visualizes simulated sensor data on a static chart. Using Apache Kafka for data streaming, Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration, and Flask paired with Plotly for chart generation, the setup seamlessly aggregates and displays data, showing skills in application, data, and infrastructure architecture.
