My primary objective in designing this project was to create a technical challenge that couldn't be constructed by ChatGPT due to its limitations both at the time of its creation. This project also showcases my background in Software Engineering, Data, and IT while demonstrating my ability to think unconventionally and showcase my skills in future-thinking methods.

I created a time-sensitive challenge that ChatGPT, at the time, couldn't address due to its limitations in comprehending objectives with multiple intricate moving parts and its information cutoff in 2021.

The project involves building a real-time analytics system that visualizes simulated sensor data on a chart. 

Using Apache Kafka for data streaming, Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration, and Flask paired with Plotly for chart generation, the setup aggregates and displays data, showings skills in IT Security/Networking, data, application development, and software infrastructure.
