A platform engineered to automate the integration and deployment processes for simulating real-time sensor data, processing this data, and interactively presenting it through Flask with updates every minute.

Using Apache Kafka for data streaming, Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration, and Flask paired with Plotly for chart generation, the setup aggregates and displays data, showings skills in IT Security/Networking, data, application development, and software infrastructure.
