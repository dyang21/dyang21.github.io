My primary objective in designing this project was to showcase IT and software engineering skills through a technical challenge that AI couldn't address due to its inherent limitations.

I presented a complex challenge that ChatGPT couldn't handle due to its inability to comprehend objectives with multiple intricate moving parts and its information cutoff in 2021.

The project involves building a real-time analytics system that visualizes simulated sensor data on a chart. 

Using Apache Kafka for data streaming, Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration, and Flask paired with Plotly for chart generation, the setup seamlessly aggregates and displays data, showing skills in application, data, and infrastructure architecture.
